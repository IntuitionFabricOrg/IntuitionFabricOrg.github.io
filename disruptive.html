										<h3>What is Deep Learning (DL) and why is it important?</h3>
										<p>To understand its importance in our world we have to begin to evaluate what is defined as Deep Learning and how this might
											impact our day to day lives.
										</p>
										<p>
											To summarize, Artificial Intuition (AI or Deep Learning) is technology that is demonstrably superior to previous AI methods.
											The smartest companies in the world are migrating their infrastructure to support this new paradigm. AI is a departure from
											the traditional reductionist way of thinking and is an entirely new way of “automating automation.” DL is enabling self-driving
											cars and other self-driving automation. DL is supporting work by not only providing assistive capabilities, but also more
											creative generative capabilities. DL is also enabling the prediction of human behavior. The weaponization of AI to manipulate
											human behavior has begun to emerge. The major companies are acquiring DL talent like there’s no tomorrow. Like it or not
											DL is the future and that future is now.
										</p>
										<p>
											While DL seemed to previously be a far fetched notion, many professionals are beginning to see the value in this technology.
										</p>
										<p>
											Google’s founder Sergey Brin, an extremely talented computer scientist, stated in a recent World Economic Forum discussion
											that he himself did not even foresee deep learning:
										</p>
										<blockquote>
											“The revolution in deep nets has been very profound, it definitely surprised me, even though I was sitting right there.”
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											This “revolution” has been noticed by others like, Sundar Pichai who in a recent quarterly financial call said:
										</p>
										<blockquote>
											"Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re re-thinking how we’re doing everything,"
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											The more precise term is “Deep Learning.” He just described it in terms that perhaps the less educated financial press could
											comprehend.
										</p>
										<p>
											DL progress has also been taking the academic community by storm. Two articles by practitioners of classical machine learning
											have summarized why they think DL is taking over the world. Chris Manning, a renowned expert in NLP, writes about the “Deep
											learning Tsunami“:
										</p>
										<blockquote>
											Deep learning waves have lapped at the shores of computational linguistics for several years now, but 2015 seems like the
											year when the full force of the tsunami hit the major Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences. However, some pundits
											are predicting that the final damage will be even worse.
										</blockquote>
										<p>

											The same sentiment is expressed by Nicholas Paragios, who works in the field of computer vision. Paragios writes in “Computer
											Vision Research: the Deep Depression“:
										</p>
										<blockquote>
											It might be simply because deep learning on highly complex, hugely determined in terms of degrees of freedom graphs once
											endowed with massive amount of annotated data and unthinkable — until very recently — computing power can solve all computer
											vision problems. If this is the case, well it is simply a matter of time that industry (which seems to be already the case)
											takes over, research in computer vision becomes a marginal academic objective and the field follows the path of computer
											graphics (in terms of activity and volume of academic research).
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											Despite the overwhelming potential of DL and its possible benefits, it is still a “Disruptive” technology that is taking
											over operations of the most advanced technology companies in the world.

											<h3>Examples</h3>
											<p>The idea is to build a democratized Deep Learning system that anyone with INT 
												tokens have access to AI to perform their daily activities
												while preserving their privacy. Here are a few examples:
											</p>
												<ul>
												<li>Automatically reading personal and confidential email and replying.
												</li><li>Automatically categorizing one's own personal data.
												</li><li>Advanced searching of confidential data.
												</li><li>Conversion of confidential unstructured data into knowledge bases.
												</li><li>Reducing information overload from confidential sources.
												</li><li>Running prediction algorithms that monitor markets.
												</li>
												</ul>	
												This list will continue to grow, so the value proposition is to provide 'frictionless' access 
												to these capabilities while still preserving one's own privacy.  
												So think of having an 'app store' of Deep Learning applications that you can make 
												use of with your email reader or similar apps.
