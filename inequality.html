								<h3>Monopolization of Artificial Intuition (AI) or Deep Learning (DL)</h3>
								<p>Despite the overwhelming potential of DL and its possible benefits, 
									it is still a &ldquo;Disruptive&rdquo; technology that is taking over operations 
									of the most advanced technology companies in the world</p>
								
								<h3>Why is DL such a &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; technology? 
									&nbsp;Why is DL taking over the most advanced tech.
            						companies in the world?</h3>
    
    
    							<p>One can easily answer both of those questions by realizing that AI technologies could very possibly 
									lead to the next global arms race. &nbsp; Dylan Love, supports this idea as he writes about solutions
									 to solving the AI arms race in
									<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/mach/features/next-global-arms-race-aims-perfect-artificial-intelligence-n685911">The Next Global Arms Race Aims to Perfect AI</a>
									:</p>
    					        
								<ul>
									<li>&ldquo;Make AI development illegal, 
										but history suggests that prohibition doesn&rsquo;t work.</li>
        							<li>Win the AI race.</li>
           							<li>Assemble an international AI consortium, with many nations pooling their resources.</li>
					                <li>Every nation unites under one flag and one leadership.&rdquo; </li>
               					</ul>

								<p><li>Not a very promising list of options. &nbsp;The threat of AI is not some futuristic idea, it is indeed here today and will become ever more sophisticated and controlling. &nbsp;Love however forgets to include a fifth option, solving the AI arms race in such a way that permits the sharing of AI across all of humanity. &nbsp;However until that happens, DL technology and DL expertise will be cornered by most of the world&rsquo;s largest
										    technology companies completely monopolizing it and creating an increase in the gap between economic groups. &nbsp;Yoshua Bengio makes the following comments in a recent </li>
                    				<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/298e2ac0-b010-11e6-a37c-f4a01f1b0fa1">Financial Times interview</a>:</p>

								
                				<p>&ldquo;Industry has been recruiting a lot of talent &mdash; there&rsquo;s a shortage in academia. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fine for those companies, but it&rsquo;s not great for academia.&rdquo;</p>
                				
								<p>Wired has a similar article <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/giant-corporations-hoarding-worlds-ai-talent/">Giant Corporations are Hoarding the World&rsquo;s AI Talent:</a>
                    			</p>
                  				
								<p>&ldquo;Even the big players talk about the tiny talent pool: Microsoft research chief Peter Lee says the cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback.&rdquo;</p>
                   
				   			    <p>As a result, Deep Learning is thriving in many of these giant corporations who are therefore monopolizing the DL technology and very possibly much of the resources, jobs, and control of our future:</p>
                        
							    <p>These firms have made heavy investments in deep learning. &nbsp;Different organizations have their different priorities in what they believe is important. The likely winner of the AI race will be the 
									company that actually is lucky enough to have put resources into the winning approach! It is indeed very odd, &nbsp;given the high stakes involved, that there is an implicit gamble every firm is willing 
									to take to get a spot as the frontrunner in the AI market. </p>
                        
						        <p>Unfortunately, for a majority of the world&rsquo;s companies and population, most don&rsquo;t 
									even know that the race exists! &nbsp;Even if they did know, just participating in the race has extremely low odds of success. &nbsp; Deep learning is reserved for the elite few and leading companies which will continue to guarantee that they will have the winning hand. &nbsp; 
									Deep learning needs to be democratized in order to create a more equitable global society. </p>
