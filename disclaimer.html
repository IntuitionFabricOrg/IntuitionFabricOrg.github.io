whatsoever. Intuition Machine expressly disclaims any and all responsibility
for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising
directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this
document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or
(iii) any action resulting therefrom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>The Intuiton Fabirc (iFab) token, or INT, is a cryptographic token used by the iFab
application INT is not a cryptocurrency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>At the time of this writing, (i) with the exception of being used to
place ads on the iFab platform, INT cannot be exchanged for goods or services,
(ii) INT has no known uses outside the iFab application, and (iii) INT cannot
be traded on any known exchanges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=normal><span>INT is not an investment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>There is no guarantee &#8211; indeed there is no reason to believe
&#8211; that the INT you purchase will increase in value. It may &#8211; and
probably will at some point &#8211; decrease in value. Those who do not
actually use their INT honestly and fairly may lose their right to use INT and
may lose their INT to those that do use INT honestly and fairly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=normal><span> INT is not evidence of ownership or right to control.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=normal><span>Controlling INT does not grant its controller ownership or equity in
Intuition Machine, or the iFab application. INT does not grant any right to
participate in the control, direction or decision making of Intuition Machine
or the iFab application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=normal><span>RISK DISCLOSURES<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>1) Risk of Losing Access to INT Due to Loss of Credentials<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>The purchaser's INT may be associated with a iFab account until they are
distributed to the purchaser. The iFab account can only be accessed with login
credentials selected by the purchaser. The loss of these credentials will
result in the loss of INT. Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store
credentials in one or more backup locations geographically separated from the
working location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>2) Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>INT and the iFab application are based on the Ethereum protocol. As
such, any malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack
on the Ethereum protocol may cause the iFab application or INT to malfunction
or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of
account of the Ethereum protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to INT,
and also other ways. More information about the Ethereum protocol is available
at http://www.ethereum.org.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>3) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>Any third party that gains access to or learns of the purchaser's login
credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser's INT. To
minimize this risk, the purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to
their electronic devices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>4) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span >Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various
regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the iFab application and
INT could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including
the licensing of or restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital
tokens like INT, which could impede, limit or end the development of the iFab
application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>5) Risk of Alternative, Unofficial iFab Application<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>Following the Crowdsale and the development of the initial version of
the INT platform, it is possible that alternative applications could be established,
which use the same open source code and protocol underlying the iFab
application. The official iFab application may compete with these alternative,
unofficial INT -based applications, which could potentially negatively impact
the Lunyr application and INT, including its value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>6) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the iFab Application or Distributed
Applications<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>It is possible that the iFab application will not be used by a large
number of businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will
be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed
applications. Such a lack of interest could negatively impact INT and the iFab
application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>7) Risk that the iFab Application, As Developed, Will Not Meet the
Expectations of iFab or the Purchaser<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>The iFab application is presently under development and may undergo
significant changes before release. Any expectations or assumptions regarding
the form and functionality of the iFab application or INT (including
participant behavior) held by Intuition Machine or the purchaser may not be met
upon release, for any number of reasons including mistaken assumptions or
analysis, a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the iFab
application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>8) Risk of Theft and Hacking<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to
interfere with the iFab application or the availability of INT in any number of
ways, including service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware
attacks, or consensus based attacks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>9) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the INT Application Core
Infrastructure<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span
>Software<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>The iFab application consists of open source software that is based on
other open source software. There is a risk that the Intuition Machine team, or
other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses
or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the iFab application
interfering with the use of or causing the loss of INT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>10) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>Cryptography<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development
of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the iFab
platform, which could result in the theft or loss of INT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>11) Risk of INT Mining Attacks<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies,
the blockchain used for the iFab application is susceptible to mining attacks,
including double- spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, selfish
-mining attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a
risk to the iFab application, INT, and expected proper execution and sequencing
of Ethereum contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Intuition Machine
team, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>12) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the iFab Application<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>While INT should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over
time. That value may be limited if the iFab application lacks use and adoption.
If this becomes the case, there may be few or no markets following the launch
of the platform, potentially having an adverse impact on INT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>13) Risk of an Illiquid Market for INT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>There very well may never be a secondary market for INT. There are
currently no exchanges upon which INT would trade. If ever exchanges do
develop, they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood
regulatory oversight. They may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure
than established, regulated exchanges for other products and have a negative
impact on INT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=normal><span>14) Risk of Uninsured Losses<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions,
funds held using the iFab application or Ethereum network are generally
uninsured. In the event of any loss, there is no public insurer, such as the
FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to the purchaser.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>15) Risk of Dissolution of the iFab Project<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an
unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether, development issues with the iFab
application, the failure of business relationships, or competing intellectual
property claims, the iFab project may no longer be viable as a business or
otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>16) Risk of Malfunction in the iFab Application<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>It is possible that the iFab application malfunctions in an unfavorable
way, including one that results in the loss of INT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>17) Unanticipated Risks<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=normal><span>Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to
the risks discussed in this White Paper, there are risks that the iFab team
cannot anticipate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=normal><span>Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or
variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
